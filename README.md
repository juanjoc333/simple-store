# simple-store
A very simple challenge for fun

We are about to launch a new Tech Store, but we need some data from our current inventory.
We have two important stories to cover before we move forward

================================

FRE-101 - Category product totals

As an admin, I want to be able to get how much money each category will get us once all products are sold

AC:
Complete [get_category_totals](main.py) function so we can know the total cost each category of product holds in
the Store

================================

FRE-102 - Products stats (BONUS)

As an admin, I want to have some quick insights about the Store. For now we need to know how many products are there
and the total net worth of such products

AC:
Complete [get_products_stats](main.py) function in main.py so our admins can get this information quickly from the DB

================================

Notes:
- Always try to make code extensible
- It's safer to work in branches
- Unit tests FTW
- Ask for help
- Have fun
